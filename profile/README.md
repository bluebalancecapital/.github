# BlueBalance Capital

## About

BlueBalance Capital is an independent, owner-managed alternative asset management company based in Vienna. The firm specializes in an investment approach that seeks to monetize dislocations, relative value and behavioral biases in derivatives markets. Our founding partners have extensive experience in derivatives from both a buy-side as well as sell-side perspective.

BlueBalance Capital views asset management through the eyes of an institutional investor. We provide clients with an investment offering that has a low correlation to traditional financial assets, employs a rigorous risk-management framework and has a particular focus on downside protection. Our investment strategy combines a research-based approach to investing, innovative use of technology and information with practical market experience.

We believe that in order to perform differently than our peers, we have to do things differently.

## ESG

BlueBalance Capital is a signatory of the United Nations supported [Principles for Responsible Investment ("PRI")](https://www.unpri.org/), an investment framework which aligns with our own sustainability initiative, to help support sustainability and environmental responsibility globally.
